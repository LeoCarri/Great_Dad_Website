                            <p>It's about being consistently available for our kids through good times and bad. Being personally engaged in our kids' lives, interests, hopes and dreams on a daily basis. Being curious and attentive requires us to put our distractions to one side. Showing compassion, hope and belief when our child needs it most.</p>

                            <p>Parenting Tips for Dads:</p>
                            <p>1. <strong>Spend time with your child.</strong> How a father spends his time reveals to his child what is important to him. Kids grow up quickly and the time to bond is now.</p>
                            <p>2. <strong>Discipline with love and positive parenting.</strong> All children need positive guidance and discipline, not as punishment, but to set reasonable limits. Dads should remind children of the consequences of their actions and positively acknowledge desirable behavior.</p>
                            <p>3. <strong>Be your childs role model.</strong> Whether they realize it or not, fathers are role models to their kids. A girl who spends time with a loving father grows up knowing she deserves to be treated with respect by boys and she learns what to look for in a partner. Fathers teach boys and girls what is important in life by demonstrating honesty, humility and responsibility.</p>
                            <p>4. <strong>Earn the right to be heard.</strong> Fathers should begin conversations with their children about important topics when they are very young so that difficult subjects will be easier to handle as they get older. Take time for listening to your childs ideas and problems.</p>
                            <p>5. <strong>Be your childs teacher.</strong> To be a good father, teach your children about right and wrong and encourage them to do their best. See that your children make good choices.</p>
                            <p>6. <strong>Eat together as a family.</strong> An important part of healthy family life is bonding through family meals. It gives kids the chance to talk about what they are doing and want to do. It is also a good time for fathers to listen and be involved. It provides a structure for families to be together each day.</p>
                            <p>7. <strong>Read to your child.</strong> In a modern world dominated by television and internet, it is important that fathers make the effort to read to their children in order to grow lifelong readers. Begin reading when they are very young and as they get older, encourage them to read on their own. Instilling a love of reading is one of the best ways to ensure children will have a lifetime of literacy and personal and career growth.</p>
                            <p>8. <strong>Respect the other parent of your child.</strong> Parents who respect each other and demonstrate mutual respect to their children, provide a secure environment for them.</p>
